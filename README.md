# Welcome to my personal website


Hey 👋🏾 I'm Luc, a software and machine learning engineer. I have hands-on experience building backend applications and machine learning / deep learning models for various use cases in Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. I value efficiency when writing programs, and applying best practices to ensure high code quality.

I enjoy writing computer programs, building machine learning models from scratch to deepen my understanding of the underlying algorithms, and also applying them with high-level libraries to real-world data.
